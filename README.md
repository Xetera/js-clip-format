# js-clip-format

Format the javascript/typescript code in your clipboard. If you're asking for help online, the least you can do is make sure your code is pretty and easy to read.

When you copy paste code from an indented block in your text editor, that indentation carries out to other programs. That's pretty annoying.

Don't be this loser
